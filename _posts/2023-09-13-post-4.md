It was motivating to present my work "Shape Sensitivity for Thermoacoustic Instability of Annular Combustors using Adjoints" in SoTiC at ETH Zurich.

I again realized that the open-source software development is crucial to understand and solve engineering problems better.

As a hashtag#YLSY proud, I am grateful to be supported by Türkiye Ministry of National Education for my PhD in University of Cambridge.

I would also like to thank University of Cambridge for funding my conference travel.
