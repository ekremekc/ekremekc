As we are interested in optimization problems in engineering, we need to represent the geometry of the system and simulate the relevant physics through various numerical tools. We heavily use finite element method when discretizing the partial differential equations. We aim to be licence-independent when using the numerical tools. Some of them are listed below. Following them, we present some of our research findings.
