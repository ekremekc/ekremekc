As we are interested in optimization problems in engineering, we need to represent the geometry of the system and simulate the relevant physics through various numerical tools. We heavily use finite element method when discretizing the partial differential equations.  

# Softwares we use

We aim to be licence-independent when using the numerical tools. We specialize in the applications with [FEniCS project](https://fenicsproject.org/) and its components. Some of them are listed below.

* [Ubuntu/Linux](https://ubuntu.com/)
  * [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) -> Automating tasks in Linux environment.
* [FEniCSx](https://github.com/FEniCS) -> Formulation of the weak form and assembling matrices for FEM applications.
  * [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/overview/) -> Building sparse matrices and solving linear systems.
  * [SLEPc](https://slepc.upv.es/) -> Solving eigenvalue problems.
  * [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) -> For parallelization applications.
  * [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) -> 3D FEM mesh generation.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
  * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/)
  * [C++](https://cplusplus.com/)
* [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/)
